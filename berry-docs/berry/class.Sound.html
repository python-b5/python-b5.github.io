<div class='doc'>
<p>Sound data that can later be played.</p>
<p>Sound data is loaded from disk - the constructor is passed a path to an audio file to load. Each audio file should only be loaded once, since it would be a waste of memory to load the same sound multiple times. The same <code>Sound</code> object can be reused for as many purposes as necessary.</p>
<p>Both WAV and Ogg Vorbis audio files are supported. Generally, it is best to use WAV for sound effects, and Ogg for music.</p></div><h3 id='constructor'>

<div class='doc'><p>Starts playback of <code>self</code>.</p>
<p>Several options can be configured through optional keyword arguments. They are passed directly into <code>PlayingSound</code>&#39;s constructor, and so are roughly equivalent to setting the values manually through <code>PlayingSound</code>&#39;s various methods. They are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>looping</code> determines whether the <code>PlayingSound</code> should loop upon finishing.</li>
<li><code>position</code> is used as the initial playback position for the <code>PlayingSound</code>, in seconds. It must be between <code>0.0</code> and the length of <code>self</code>.</li>
<li><code>volume</code> is used as the initial volume for the <code>PlayingSound</code>, as a multiplier applied to <code>self</code>&#39;s original volume.</li>
<li><code>speed</code> is used as the initial speed for the <code>PlayingSound</code>, as a multiplier applied to <code>self</code>&#39;s original speed. It must be between <code>0.0</code> and <code>100.0</code> (the latter limit is inherited from SDL, which Berry uses internally - if a different library were used for sound playback instead, that limit would likely not be in place).</li>
</ul>
<div class='linkblock' id='errors.play'><a href='#errors.play'>Errors</a></div>
<ul>
<li><code>ValueError</code> if any invalid values are passed as options.</li>
